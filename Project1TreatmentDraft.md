# Combing the Backwater*

## I - High Concept
The player explores the dilapidated outskirts of their city in hopes of solving a clod case.

## II - Genre
Adventure

## III - Platform
Desktop Only/ Universal

## IV - Story
**Theme** - N/A
**Mood** - Suspenseful, grim

**Narrative** - While they search, the player will find hints and clues that bring them closer and closer to solving the case they were assigned. 

**Premise** - Rookie Green Dragons Detective Danielle Rogers* has been assigned a peculiar murder case, which has long since been closed. Her guildmaster's lead brings her to the Backwater, the seedy parts of Huntsdale on the outskirts, and the infamous den of the city's undesirables.

**Motivation** - The player's motivation would be to solve the case that Danielle was assigned.

## V - Aesthetics
Cartoonish, yet mature (ideally). If need be, art can be simplified to match the skill of the developer.

## VI - Gameplay
### VI.i - Mechanics
The player will be able to decide which of the inhabitants of the Backwater they speak to, and have to piece together the clues they find to deduce things about the case.

### VI.ii - Control
Keyboard/Mouse/Touch(Ideally)

### VI.iii - New User Experience
While the gameplay is meant to be rather simple, the game will briefly explain, in the form of a conversation between Danielle and another guildman, how to go about investigating and collecting clues, amounting to a tutorial.

### VI.iv - Player Learning
There is nothing in particular that needs to be learned. Throughout the game, the player's deductive reasoning will be the only thing between them and being completely stuck.
