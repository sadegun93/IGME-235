Repository for Introduction to Game Web Technology at RIT

Being very passionate about fantasy, writing, and games, my dream is to make games (and other forms of media) with stories and characters that fans can become invested in. Ideally, people would become inspired, make friends and find loves ones, and grow as people after being exposed to my games, stories, characters, and themes.
